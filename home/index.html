          <h1>Folds</h1>
          <p>The folds of Elephant Pants are what set them above other pants. Not only do the folds create a distinct look and feel, but they also make Elephant Pants stronger. The Shar Pei pictured above was an ideal fighting dog because of its wrinkly skin. In the same way, the folds of Elephant Pants will protect them from the attacks of life.</p>
